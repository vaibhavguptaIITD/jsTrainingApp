		<p>Data comes in various types in javascript. As in any other
			programming language javascript comes with following datatypes:
		<ul>
			<li>Numbers
				<p>Numbers are quantities. You can do math with them.</p>
			</li>
			<li>Strings
				<p>
					Strings are sequences of characters, like the letters
					<code>a-z</code>
					, spaces, and even numbers. These are all strings:
					<code>"Vaibhav"</code>
					,
					<code>"4"</code>
					and
					<code>"What is your name?"</code>
					Strings are extremely useful as labels, names, and content for your
					programs.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>Boolean
				<p>
					A boolean can have only two values, <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. You can use them in your code by making statements that evaluate to <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li><code>undefined</code>
				<p>
					<code>undefined</code> means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value. 
				</p>
			</li>
			<li><code>null</code>
				<p>
					<code>null</code> is an assignment value. It can be assigned to a variable as a representation of no value. 
				</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
