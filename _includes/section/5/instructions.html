		<h4><code>while</code></h4>
		<p>The <code>while</code> loop is ideal when you want to use a loop, but you don't know how many times you'll have to execute that loop.</p>
		<h4></h4>
<pre>
while(condition){
    // Do something!
}
</pre>
		<p>
		As long as the condition evaluates to <code>true</code>, the loop will continue to run. As soon as it's <code>false</code>, it'll stop.
